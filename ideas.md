# Replit Project Ideas

### It would be cool if (dev)...

* As a developer, I want to go to my companies page and see a list of issues. After clicking the issue, I am promped if I want to create a branch for this issue. After selecting yes, replit opens up a new repl for me on a new branch and I can address the issue all from replit.

* As a startup founder, I want to be able to create tickets without having to open github. I want to be able to assign people and add them to project milestones/sprints.

* Replit actions (github actions but fully controlled by replit)

* A template that demonstrates the ability for two always-on repls to talk to eachother.

* ... we created a repository-like system. Teams could have groupings of code, like repositories. 

### It would be cool if (not dev)...

* ... we had a replit guide for using git and using replit's git tab to build complex projects. This could explain the importance of git and why we use it as developers.

* ... we could write a guide for writing effective tests.
